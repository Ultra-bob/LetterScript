# LetterScript
LetterScript is a rather daft language where no characters other than the English alphabet (and whitespace!) are allowed anywhere in the code (Including strings!)
It's called LetterScript because there are only letters and it's my first time using TypeScript (or JavaScript)

## Syntax
is even Example
```
FUNCTION is even WITH number DOES
    IF FN MOD number DIV two END THEN
        RETURN even END
    ELSE
        RETURN odd END
    END
END

FN PRINT FN is even WITH five END END
```

- Language keywords are always in UPPERCASE like SQL
- Function arguments have to be named after the first. Naming the first argument is not allowed
For example,  `ADD 1 PLUS 1`
is the same as `add(1, plus=1)` in Python
- Numbers are not allowed, so instead they are written like `twenty five point one two`
