# LetterScript
LetterScript is a rather daft language where no characters other than the English alphabet (and whitespace!) are allowed anywhere in the code (Including strings!)
It's called LetterScript because there are only letters and it's my first time using TypeScript (or JavaScript)

## Syntax
FizBuzz Example
```
FUNCTION fizzbuzz WITH number DOES
    IF FN MOD i DIV two
DONE
```

Language keywords are always in UPPERCASE like SQL
Function arguments have to be named after the first. Naming the first argument is not allowed
For example,  `ADD 1 PLUS 1`
is the same as `add(1, plus=1)` in Python
